# Merging vs. Rebasing
It is my opinion that when you are working on a feature branch and want to pull in latest master you should rebase instead of merge.

# Resolving conflicts
When git fails to deal with conflicts for you, it can be error prone and hard work. There are plenty of tools to make it easier. I use intelliJ. You can see how to set that up [here](http://brian.pontarelli.com/2013/10/25/using-idea-for-git-merging-and-diffing/).
